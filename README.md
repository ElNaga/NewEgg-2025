Python 3.6.9

Standard requests were blocked, so that hurdle was overcome by using TLS Client. Before I've used chromium to load pages when this was the case, but I saw that now there is another way to generate proper fingerprint.

SearchKeyword API has fake limit of 4 item responses.

Real API was found using Network -> Fetch/XHR

there was no use of using multiple threads for workers to scrap, since i got a timeout BLOCK from newegg

I did 1s per request, to not have my IP blocked again.

I had an issue to find the proper categoryIDs, so I resorted to manualy finding the ID's for categories, and using them dynamically for the items[and item IDs]. I am sure this can be done as well programatically. 


Have a good day!
